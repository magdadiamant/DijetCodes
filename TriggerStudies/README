In order to perform the trigger efficiency studies we run two different analyzers.
The first one is the standard one: analysisClass_mainDijetSelection_trigger_JetHT.C (and an example of cutfile: cutFile_mainDijetSelection_trigger_JetHT_2018A.txt )
input: big trees of JetHT dataset
output: reduced trees that save the histograms that will be used in the trigger studies (more specifically the histograms that were filled with the requirement of the OR of the unprescaled triggers  will be used to identify the 1/sqrt (N) of the JetHT dataset in each bin.

The second one:analysisClass_mainDijetSelection_trigger_SingleMuon.C (and an example of cutfile:cutFile_mainDijetSelection_trigger_SingleMuon_2018A.txt)
input: big trees of SingleMuon dataset
output: educed trees that save the histograms that will be used in the trigger studies (more specifically we save the histograms that were filled with the requirement of the Mu50 (denominator) and the OR of unprescaled triggers && Mu50 (numerator)

.x trig_2017_4J_alpha.C > out.txt
the trig_2017_4J_alpha.C takes as inputs the reduced histograms from the previous steps and as output it has the plots of the trigger efficiency and  in the out.txt
we have two columns: the first one has the inefficiency and the second one the 1/sqrt(N) for each bin from the JetHT stream. We compare them when we are in the plateau ~99% and see the exact bin where the ineff< 1/sqrt(N)
